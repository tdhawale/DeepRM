  * Add multiple actions per time-step, where an action represents either an index of job slot or a phi action for no or invalid action. 
  * Update action space, specified above. 
  * Comparison of different trained models DQN with random scheduler, on different performance objectives.
  * Comparison of different trained models PPO2 and A2C with random scheduler, on different objectives, specified above.
  * Tensorboard integration in code, e.g., to plot, e.g., figure 6 of paper.
  * Reproduce competing schemes, i.e., SJF, Tetris, and Packer, which are described in the paper.
  * Create a wiki page to define the state space, action space and reward and the guideline for running source code.
  * Baselines agents should be trained for schemes Average job slowdown and Average job completion with respective rewards.
