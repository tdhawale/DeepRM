## Meeting Action Points :
 
  * Since the logs are missing for tuned model, next week needs to be saved to check why the tuned model is not giving results as expected.
  * This is already second time questioned by advisor why we have not updated the milestones yet ?
       :(we are busy with training both the environments and tuning them for each and every small enhacement done during the phase 1 break
	      as well as we corrected majority of the minor mistakes happened for discrete environment )
		  Probably we will come up with the noted tasks for phase 2.
  * Create milestones for the tasks decided to be done during phase 2.
